                <p>Jessie fell in love with complex systems and how they work while receiving her degree in Micro-Molecular Biology. After graduation, Jessie worked as a hospital Microbiologist for two years where she would, through the process of elimination, culture bacteria for the diagnosis of diseases, or spend her time staring through microscopes to correctly distinguish cancer cells from a bone marrow biopsy. Being inspired by her peers in tech Jessie wanted to apply her scientific detective work to programming. She tested the waters by completing Codecademy during lunch hours at work, at night, and on weekends. She was hooked. Two prep courses and a Javascript textbook later and Jessie is now at Hackbright excited to work as a full stack engineer.</p>
